Name: Trixie Tram Nguyen, PSID: 1518295

1. Objective: Practice 3D viewing and go deeper into OpenGL by implementing the Phong shader model.
2. Environment: Run and compile on Visual Studio 2019 on Windows with GLUT, GLEW, GLFW, and GLM libraries set up. Screenshot the result of each step of the shading (such as ambient, diffuse, and specular) to get the final result phong relection then save as png file.
3. Project details: To be able to write the vertex and fragment shaders for the Phong model to shae a simple cube with the geometry already defined in main.cpp. Camera.h and Shader.h also have been provided to produce the desire images. Need to develope the phong.frag and phong.vs, along with completing code in Camera.h to return the view matrix calculated by using Eular Angles and LookAt Matrix. In additional, main.cpp also need to be complete by generate all uniform parameter such as cube color, light color and etc. so that it could be pass into shaders. MVP (model view projection) matrix also need to be complete to pass into shaders by rotating the cube using Model matrix. Be able to use function glGetUniformLocation(), and glUniform3f, glUniformMatrix4fv to pass uniform value. Four of the images that need to be produce are the image rendered by the ambient light only, image rendered by the diffuse light only, image rendered by the specular light only, and lastly the phong shading model which is the result of the other 3 previous images.
4. Explaination of completed code that need to be added: starting from main.cpp, code have been added to define several attributes of the objects such as object color, light color, light position, view position, camera matrix, view, prespective project, and model. In order to do that, first I need to use the glGetUniformLocation to get the location to pass the object color, light color, light position and view position which have been defined in phong.frag file and store in the variables objectColorLocation, lightColorLocation, lightPosLocation and viewPosLocation respectively. Next, I use the glUniform3f function to pass in the RGB values for object color with a green color value since in the PDF hw document did not specify what color we need for the cube, and for the light color is a white color values. glUniform3f function also used to pass the position of the light position using lightPos that defined in the main.cpp and the camera position get from camera header file. Next we need to get the view, perspective projection, and the model: first we set the model to 1.0, then to get the view, we use the GetViewMatrix() function form camera.h, in that function we set radius to be 10 so the camera will rotation around the object in a distance of 10, and to create the camera x, z coordinate we use the sin and cos function take in the time using the glfwGetTime() then multiply by the radius, modify the original lookAt matrix which changing the first element to camX and the third element to camZ of the first row, the other 2 rows stay the same; next for the perspective projection we passed in the angle which is 45 degree get from camera zoom, aspect ratio getting from dividing the width and height of the screen, the third and fourth which is the near and far plane which set to 1.0 and 100.0.
